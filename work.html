                <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internships are highly valuable for students in getting meaningful experience in your undergraduate career, from companies or organizations typically involved with educational institutions. Especially in neuroscience, being exposed to other people in the field, as well as the connections made, is great in getting a look into and starting up your post-educational career.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a list of resources that can help you find neuroscience internships, as well as links to information great in acquiring those internships.
                </p>
                <br>

                <ul>
   <li><a href="https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Discipline.aspx?sort=MED-NeuroSci_Neuroscience"> PathwaysToScience.org </a>
                                        <ul><li> This is a great resource for finding internships across the country, with opportunities to apply no matter which stage of education you are at - highschool, undergraduate, post-graduate. </li></ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5047">National Science Foundation</a>
                                <ul><li> Although the site is broader in scope, referencing Biological Sciences, it can be specified for neuroscience internships. However, the best part about this website is the contact information being provided for program coordinators, to get a step in the door as well as more information about the program. </li></ul>
                        </li>

                        It can also be pretty nerve-wracking to figure out the internship process, and there is tons of advice that we've used in our applications that have helped a lot in getting those positions. Here are some links on how to apply to internships properly that we've used before.
                </p>

                If those links feel too confusing, we've also referenced a lot of different videos when applying for these internships. This first one provides some great tips in what you'll need to apply.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                This link we found especially helpful since undergraduate STEM majors typically aren't familiar with cold-contacting. This breaks down that barrier a lot, and is a great way to get a leg up in your application.
